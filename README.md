# bq_websocket

Single source file WebSocket library.
The library itself (bq_websocket.h/c) does not do any IO, but supports both callback and buffer based external IO.
The repository also contains a reference platform implementation (bq_websocket_platform.h/c) supporting non-blocking BSD sockets on Windows/Posix,
CFStream on Apple platforms, and browser WebSocket implementation on Emscripten. SSL is supported via OpenSSL if `BQWS_PT_USE_OPENSSL` is defined to a non-zero value.
